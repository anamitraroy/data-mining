How to run the files?

Step 1: Please download the .ipynb file, and then open it in an environment that supports the execution of .ipynb files, viz. Jupyter Notbooks or Google Colab.
Step 2: Execute the program cell-by-cell.

Please note that in order to run correctly, the dataset must be placed at the exact path given in the file! So, if you're using Google Colab, you can place the file 
at a directory with the same path as the one given in the data_dir variable in Cell 4.

If you're not using Google Colab, you will have to change the data_dir path to one that corresponds to where your dataset is stored.
